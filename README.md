This is a collection of codes and scripts that I use frequently or that come in handy in various situations.

I will list in this README file an index and short descriptions of every item contained in this repo.
If you have something to add please DONT HESITATE!  I love expanding my library...

REDSBROWSER.PY - This is a module i've put together for myself that I use almost every time I access the internet with python.  It copies cookies from the Firefox Browser and loads them  into a python script returning a cookiejar, mechanize browser, and urllib2.opener (depending on what task i'm performing) meaning website logins are usually already taken care of and I don't have to add more code logging into websites.

GET_PUBLIC_IP.PY - Short little script that will access canyouseeme.org and check to see what ip address you're currently broadcasting to the internet.

sync_folders.py - Cool looking Python GUI for syncing 2 folders.  Originally found on ubuntuforums submitted by mushy365 who wrote it for making backups of hundreds of files downloaded from the internet. Pretty nice appearance and looks handy but I honestly havent got to try this one yet.
