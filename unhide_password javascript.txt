This is a popular one.  The first time i saw this was posted on hackthissite.org by sandbox a few years ago i think.  But i've seen it a bunch of places since then.  

This javascript will take any passwords that appear on websites as asterisks (hidden from the users view) and give you a popup of the plaintext.  I have a bookmark on my favorites bar with the following in the location box (where you would nomally put the web address) so that whenever I click it I get the pop up.  I also have a shortcut saved on my coding USB drive that I carry with me.  I can plug into another machine and click that , get the popup and unplug in less than 3 seconds.  Comes in handy:

Just paste the following in the location section of a new bookmark or shortcut and simply click the shortcut whenever you need to see the text of a hidden password on the screen. (i.e. ********)
